- 📝 Logical container used to provision resources in Azure such as virtual machines, databases and more.
- 📝 When you create an Azure resource like a VM, you identify the subscription it belongs to
  - As you use the VM, the usage of the VM is aggregated and billed monthly.

### Multiple Azure Subscriptions

- You can create new subscriptions to separate e.g.
  - **Environments**
    - E.g. for testing, security, or to isolate data for compliance reasons.
    - 💡Useful because resource access control occurs at the subscription level.
  - **Organizational structures**
    - E.g. limit a team to lower-cost resources & allow IT department a full range
    - 💡Allows you to manage and control access to the resources that users provision within each subscription
  - **Billing**
    - Costs are first aggregated at the subscription level
      - Manage and track costs based on your needs
    - E.g. for production, development, testing
- Or due to **subscription limits**:
  - Subscriptions are bound to some hard limitations
    - E.g. the maximum number of Express Route circuits per subscription is 10

      - Each **billing profile** has different invoice sections
