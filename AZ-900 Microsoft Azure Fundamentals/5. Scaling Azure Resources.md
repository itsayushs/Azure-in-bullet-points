# Scaling Azure Resources

- Suppose you deployed your website and it becomes popular. You realize that your site can't effectively manage all the requests it's receiving. To solve the problem, you'll need to increase the server's hardware capacity.
- Scale refers to adding network bandwidth, memory, storage, or compute power to achieve better performance.
- **Scaling up or vertical scaling**
  - Increase the memory, storage, or compute power on an existing virtual machine.
  - E.g. add additional memory to a web or database server to make it run faster.
- **Scaling out or horizontal scaling**
  - Add extra virtual machines to power your application. 
  - E.g., create many virtual machines configured in exactly the same way and use a load balancer to distribute work across them.
- ðŸ’¡ The cloud is **elastic**
  - **Scale down or scale in**
    - Do if you needed to scale up or scale out only temporarily.
    - Help you save money.
  - Services that help you optimize cloud spend:
    - Azure Advisor, Azure Cost Management
    - You can use these to identify where you're using more than you need
      - and then scale back to the capacity you're actually using.
