# Interacting with Azure

- **[Azure portal](#azure-portal)** for interacting with Azure via a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- **[Azure PowerShell](#azure-powershell)**,  **[Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI)](#azure-cli)** and **[Azure SDKs](#azure-sdks)** for command line and automation-based interactions with Azure
- **[Azure Cloud Shell](#azure-cloud-shell)** for a web-based command-line interface
- **[Azure mobile app](#azure-mobile-app)** for monitoring and managing your resources from your mobile device

## Azure portal

- Public website you can access with any browser.
- Likely to be the primary way you will interact with Azure.
- Lets you create, manage, monitor your Azure resources (almost anything you can do on Azure).
- Guides you through complex administrative tasks using wizards and tooltips.
- **Resource panel**
  - In the left-hand sidebar & lists main resource types.
  - The resources listed are part of your ***favorites***.
  - Customizable, can also change default view ***Home*** through Dashboard > Settings
- **Azure Marketplace**
  - Provision services (more than 8.000) from different providers, all certified to run on Azure.
    - e.g. virtual machine images, databases, application build and deployment software, developer tools, threat detection, and blockchain.
- Using Azure portal gets repetitive and are candidates for automation with [CLI](#azure-cli) & [PowerShell](#azure-powershell)

- Advisor analyzes your deployed services and looks for ways to improve your environment across those areas.
- You can view recommendations in the portal or download them in PDF or CSV format.

### Dashboards

- High-level details about your Azure environment.
- Customize by moving and resizing tiles, and displaying services
  - At the top you to create, upload, reset, download (JSON), edit, clone, switch, delete and share a dashboard.
  - In **Tile Gallery** you have different tiles such as Clock, ARM data, Audit Logs, Service Health, AD Connect.
    - Some tiles have editable settings, e.g. for clock you can set the time zone.
  - 💡 You can take elements on child panes and put them on your dashboard. Hover the item in `...` menu select "Pin to Dashboard"
- Multiple dashboards are supported, and you can switch between them as needed.
  - E.g. DB admin would have a dashboard that contains views of the SQL database service
  - E.g. Azure Active Directory administrator would have views of the users and groups within Azure AD
- You can share your dashboards with other team members.
  - You can unpublish to unshare.
- You can use role-based access control (RBAC) to control who can access that dashboard
- Azure stores dashboards within resource groups as JSON files
  - so you can customize them [programmatically](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/azure-portal-dashboards-create-programmatically)
  - 💡 The easiest starting point is to download the dashboard JSON as previously described and edit that file.
  - 💡 You can also distribute the dashboard JSON file to other users.
- The default dashboard is named Dashboard.

## Azure PowerShell

- Module that you can install for Windows PowerShell or PowerShell Core (cross-platform, linux/win/macOS)
- E.g. create a new virtual machine: `New-AzVM -ResourceGroupName "MyResourceGroup" -Name "TestVm" -Image "UbuntuLTS"`
- Scripting environment for automation just like [Azure CLI](#azure-cli)

## Azure CLI

- Cross-platform (linux/win/macOS) command-line program that connects to Azure and executes commands on Azure.
- E.g. to create VM first login `az login` then create a resource group and execute:
  - `az vm create --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name TestVm --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys`

## Azure Cloud Shell

- You can reach on portal (top right `>_`icon)
  - or through visiting [shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com )
